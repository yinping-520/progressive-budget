## Description
```
Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.

Our app will be able to track withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when offline
